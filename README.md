# Envelope Budgeting Single Page Application

This repo is a possible implementation of the [Envelope  Budgeting API](https://github.com/allanbernartt/envelopes-api) using ReactJS

This project was built as part of my personal portfolio.

It helped me solidify the knowledge regarding `ReactJS` concepts and libraries such as:

- Single Page Application (SPA)
- [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
- [custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)
- [CSSTransition](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)
- MVC architecture
- [Code Splitting, Lazy Loading and Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html)
- among other things such as Deployment, Mobile First, React Context, Data Persintency, etc.

## Running the app
To run locally, run `npm install`, then `npm start` and open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
